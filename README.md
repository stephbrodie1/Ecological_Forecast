# Description:

See Brodie et al. (in review), for full methods description and results. 

Data:
Global SST forecasts can be accessed at the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/NMME/). Output from the UCSC CCS reanalysis is available from https://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu. The downscaled SST forecasts and forecasts of HCI and TOTAL generated in this study have been deposited in dryad: doi:10.5061/dryad.z08kprrjr. Source data are provided with the paper. The real-time HCI (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/whale_indices/) and TOTAL (https://coastwatc h.pfeg.noaa.gov/loggerheads/index.html) management tools are publicly accessible.
